### Hi there, I'm Dave! <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCelticGuy"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33559521/230700995-345ff3ff-8e35-447d-9666-f4a56b0295e9.png"/></a>

As a physics graduate and a self taught hobby programmer of many years. I am passionate about creating interesting things with programming in my spare time 
and would love to do software development for a career.

I have been developing in Unity3D since 2016, and have spent a large portion of my time learning game development techniques which covers many different subjects.

I am keen to take on things I have not done before so any oppotunity to learn and do new things is a plus to me!

**Note**<br>
At some point I will add more previews of things I have learnt and developed as a lot of my repos are private projects which cannot be posted publicly.
